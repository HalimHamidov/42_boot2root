Since bridged adapter is blocked in the school - I setup kali linux vm and boot-to-root vm through host-only adapter.
I created local network through *VirtualBox->File->Host network manager*, and it's ip *192.168.56.1/24*.
Now, there is a local network with kali vm, boot-to-root vm and host computer.
And kali will see only host computet and boot-to-root vm.
My kali linux ip is 192.168.56.101 (through *ip a*).
And we need to check how can we interact with boot-to-root vm. For this I check all available ports im my local network with *nmap 192.168.56.1-225*

For only one non host port in my local network I received:
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.102
Host is up (0.0010s latency).
Not shown: 994 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
21/tcp  open  ftp
22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
143/tcp open  imap
443/tcp open  https
993/tcp open  imaps

So boot-to-root vm running on 192.168.56.102 ip, and have few open ports.

On http there is site, which is pretty empty, I check it html source code and there is nothing interesting in it. 
After that I scanned it with *skipfish -o path_to_save http://192.168.56.102* and *nikto -h http://192.168.56.102*, and in sub dirs I got only fonts and icons so it's completely useless (I think).

There is another open port which could be scanned, it's https.
*skipfish* now is useless, because https://192.168.56.102 returns 404, but with *nikto -h https://192.168.56.102* we have few interesting dirs: forum, webmail, phpmyadmin

On forum there are 4 topics and only one is iteresting, topic *Probleme login* where user *lmezard* push logs with attempts to log in.

In these logs we can see, what username lmezard used trying to log in *Failed password for invalid user 'username'* 
And there is interesting username in string * Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ *
And, these characters came up for lmezard password.
